### Hi, my name is Dima Riabovol :wave:

I'm a Markup developer and teacher :computer:. Strong HTML & CSS skills help me to create valid, adaptive, cross-browser web products taking into account accessibility :zap:

I have basic knowledge of JS and progressively learn it to add to my skills in close future :bulb:

I love sharing experiences with others and being useful to someone, that's why I work as an HTML/CSS teacher in online courses to turn this into reality :raised_hands:

I enjoy self-learning and feel bad if I don't learn anything new or don't do something useful in a day. In everyday life I'm a sportsman, do boxing, enjoy playing guitar and reading books :trophy: :guitar: :books:
