## Hi, my name is Dima :wave:

I'm a Front-end developer and HTML/CSS teacher :computer:. Strong engineering skills help me to create valid, adaptive, cross-browser web products taking into account accessibility. I have solid knowledge of JS and work with Angular framework :zap:

I love sharing experiences with others and being useful to someone, that's why I work as an HTML/CSS teacher in online courses to turn this into reality.

I enjoy self-learning and feel bad if I don't learn anything new or don't do something useful in a day. In everyday life I'm a sportsman, do boxing, enjoy playing guitar and reading books :trophy: :guitar: :books:
